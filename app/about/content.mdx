I'm a software developer with a keen focus on creating beautiful and intuitive user interfaces.
I specialize in React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, JavaScript and Tailwind to build scalable and efficient web applications.

I bring extensive experience in web development, having worked with companies like [Embrays Technologies](https://embraystechnologies.com/), and [HyScaler](https://hyscaler.com/).
Now I am a Junior Technical Programmer at [HyScaler](https://hyscaler.com/), where we are building the future of construction software planning.
