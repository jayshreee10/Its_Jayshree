### Introduction

Git is a widely used version control system that helps developers manage code changes efficiently. Setting up an SSH key is essential for secure authentication when interacting with remote repositories. In this article, we will cover the most important Git commands and how to set up your SSH key.

### Setting Up an SSH Key

SSH keys provide a secure way to connect to your Git repositories without using a password.

#### Step 1: Generate an SSH Key

Run the following command to generate a new SSH key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

This command will generate a public and private key pair.

#### Step 2: Add Your SSH Key to the SSH Agent

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

#### Step 3: Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account

Copy the public key to your clipboard:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Paste it into your GitHub settings under **SSH and GPG keys**.

#### Step 4: Test Your Connection

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

### Essential Git Commands

#### Cloning a Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

#### Checking the Status

```bash
git status
```

#### Adding Changes

```bash
git add .
```

#### Committing Changes

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

#### Pushing Changes

```bash
git push origin main
```

#### Pulling Changes

```bash
git pull origin main
```

#### Checking the Commit Log

```bash
git log
```

#### Creating a New Branch

```bash
git checkout -b new-branch
```

#### Merging Branches

```bash
git merge new-branch
```

#### Deleting a Branch

```bash
git branch -d new-branch
```

#### Retrieving a Previous Commit

To see the history of commits:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

To reset to a previous commit:

```bash
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```

#### Stepping Back from a Commit

To undo the last commit but keep changes:

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

To undo the last commit and discard changes:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Final Thoughts

Mastering Git commands and setting up SSH keys ensures smooth version control and secure connections to repositories. Regularly using these commands will help you manage your projects efficiently. For more tips on Git usage, stay tuned!
